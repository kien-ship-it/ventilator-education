## 1. Core Philosophy & Learning Model

- **Target Audience:** Gen Z Nurses/Learners.
- **Methodology:** Gamification, Micro-learning, and Spaced Repetition.
- **Pacing:** Designed for ~60 minutes of engagement per week (e.g., 20 min/3 sessions or 10 min/6 sessions).
- **Total Duration:** 90 Days.

## 2. Theme & Narrative

- **Genre:** Outer Space / Sci-Fi.
- **Backstory:** The user is a Registered Nurse (RN) recruited for a special mission to space. They are the "Commander of the Deflated Lung Quadrant" aboard the ship **"Coughulus-81"**.
- **Objective:** To save the planet **"Atelectasis Prime"** and defeat the villain **"Captain Collapse"**.
- **Intro Sequence:** Upon first login, a *Star Wars*style scrolling text intro explains the mission and context.

## 3. User Interface (UI) & Navigation

### Onboarding/Login

- **Credentials:** Name, Email, Password.
- **Data Privacy:** All data kept local; Feedback forms are anonymous (Google Forms link) for IRB compliance.

### The Dashboard (Map View)

- **Visual:** A map of a planet containing **6 distinct Islands**.
- **HUD Elements:**
    - **Username/Avatar** (customizable icons: astronaut, rocket, square?).
    - **Streak Counter:** Current consecutive days/weeks logged in.
    - **PEEP Points:** Current total score (Currency).
    - **Feedback Button:** Link to external anonymous Google Form.
    - *Note:* A global "Leaderboard" is **NOT** to be displayed (per handwritten notes).

### The Content Interface

- **Progress Bar:** Visible within modules.
- **Module Navigation:** Linear or non-linear (TBD, but "Library" implies choice).
- **Researcher View:** A hidden/separate screen displaying metrics: # PEEP Points, Longest Streak, Total Time.

## 4. Game Rules & Economy

### The "PEEP Points" System

- **Earning:** Users earn PEEP Points by completing content chunks (videos, quizzes, labs).
- **Redoing Content:** Users can redo quizzes/videos for practice, but **cannot** earn additional points for the same item twice (prevents farming).
- **Streaks:** Bonus points awarded for maintaining a 7-day streak.
- **Success Metric:** Researchers use the total points to verify if the user achieved 80% compliance without violating anonymity.

### The "Island" Mechanics (Spaced Repetition)

- **Total Content:** 6 Islands total (approx. 120 mins of content per island).
- **Unlock Schedule:**
    - **Day 0-30:** Islands 1 & 2 available.
    - **Day 31-60:** Islands 3 & 4 unlock.
    - **Day 61-90:** Islands 5 & 6 unlock.
    - *Visual Cue:* Locked islands appear greyed out.
- **Binge Prevention:** Potential energy system (or just the hard 30-day lock) to prevent doing all training in one day.

### Completion Logic

- **The 80% Rule:** Users must complete **80%** of the content modules within an island to unlock that island's **Final Exam**.
- **Island Clearance:** Passing the Final Exam "clears" the island and contributes to defeating Captain Collapse.

## 5. Content Modules & Interaction Types

Inside each Island, the user accesses a "Library" of mixed-media content:

1. **Videos:** Short educational clips.
2. **Readings:** Brief text segments followed immediately by a **Single Confirmation Question** to verify reading.
3. **Graphics/3D Models:** Interactive visuals (e.g., rendering of ventilator interfaces).
4. **Quizzes:**
    - Multiple Choice (MCQ).
    - Picture/Diagram identification.
    - **Mechanic:** Questions and option order must be **randomized** to allow for valid re-taking.
5. **Vent Lab:** A scrolling or interactive simulation (e.g., "Ventilating a Mannequin" pre/post-test).
6. **"Quest" (Real-life Interaction):**
    - A task requiring real-world action (e.g., Ask an instructor/RT a question).
    - **Validation:** The instructor gives the user a specific **Password**. The user enters this password into the app to complete the quest and earn points.
