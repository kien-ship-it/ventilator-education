# GAMER-ICU: Logistics & Premise
# Premise:
You are an RN on a special mission to space on the Coughluous-81 space shuttle. You have beenrecruited to planet AtelectaPrime to defeat Captain Collapse, the commander of the deflatedlung quadrant. The only way to do this is to gain knowledge, because knowledge is power! Yourmission is to travel across AtelectaPrime and collect as many PEEP points as possible over thenext 90 days. Every 30 days, two regions of AtelectaPrime will become available, each with newchallenges.
+ a tour guide (alien?) pops up to guide you through this premise?
# Time:
20 min, ~3x/week = 60 min/week to play
Estimated total time of curriculum: 240 min/month x 3 months $=$ total curriculum ~720 min
• Compliance marked by $80 \%$ of activities completed
# Regions:
6 regions total
3 months $_ { ( = 9 0 }$ days) total
$^ { \circ 2 }$ regions/month, 240 min/month = 120 min/island AND 2 islands/month (240 min/month)
All activities for the open regions are available at the start of the 30-day window.Though it is recommended to do them in order, this is not required.
Regions remain open as you progress through the months if you wish to go backand re-do activities
# Remuneration:
RNs get paid:
$\$ 10$ to take competency (baseline) exam
$\$ 10$ to take competency (end of curriculum) exam
Eligible to take exam, regardless of how much they completed
$\$ 5$ to take competency (retention) exam
$\$ 15$ ($5 for each 30-day window they were compliant (completed $80 \%$ activities) x3)
+BONUS $100 for most PEEP points
if RN participates, they can make $\$ 40$ (& knowledge $=$ power)
If RN WINS, they can make $140 (& the glory!)

# Goals & Objectives
The global goal of this curriculum is to improve pediatric ICU RN competency in IMV. Specific goals andobjectives are broken down by RN IMV competency domain.
# 1. Domain: Medical & Contextual Knowledge
Goal: A pediatric ICU RN who is competent in invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV)…
Integrates their knowledge of cardiorespiratory and airway anatomy / physiology into thegreater picture of their patient’s disease state and illness course.
Objectives: At the end of this 90-day, gamified curriculum, pediatric ICU RNs will be able to….
a) List the variables associated with ventilation and oxygenation with $100 \%$ accuracy on free textquestions on written exam.
b) Describe how the following disease processes affect oxygenation and ventilation:
o Asthma
o Bronchiolitis
o Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
o Tracheobronchomalacia
as assessed by $> / = 8 0 \%$ on a written MCQ exam.
c) Systematically interpret their patient’s most recent chest x-ray (using an ABCDE approach) todetermine if endotracheal tube placement is appropriate and identify any other pulmonarypathophysiology, as assessed by $> / = 8 0 \%$ on a written MCQ exam.
d) Interpret arterial, venous, or capillary blood gas results and identify the most appropriatemanagement option, as assessed by $> / = 8 0 \%$ on a written MCQ exam.
# 2. Domain: Autonomous Decision Making
Goals: A pediatric ICU RN who is competent in invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV)…

e) Describe the level of ventilatory support a patient is receiving by comparing current ventilatorsettings to physiologic values for patient’s age, as assessed by $> / = 8 0 \%$ on a written MCQ exam.
f) Compose an accurate, global assessment of their patient’s disease process and severity, as wellas current clinical status, by synthesizing data from physical exam, the cardiopulmonarymonitor, and the ventilator screen. This will be evaluated by achieving $> / = 7 0 \%$ congruence toan assessment statement written by the attending physician.
# 3. Domain: Technical Skills
Goals: A pediatric ICU RN who is competent in invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV)…
• Confidently provides appropriate hands-on care for an invasively ventilated patient.
• Reduces harm for invasively ventilated patients with hands-on care
• Safely navigates an unplanned extubation or tracheostomy decannulation scenario
Objectives: At the end of this 90-day, gamified curriculum, pediatric ICU RNs will be able to….
g) Pre-requisite knowledge: Demonstrate correct bag-mask ventilation (BVM) on a manikin, asevidenced by achieving adequate chest rise and end tidal CO2.
h) Pre-requisite knowledge: Demonstrate the appropriate technique for in-line suction withoutcausing patient harm (bleeding, hypoxia), as evidenced by their ability to select the properdepth of in-line suction on a Ballard catheter station (“skills” portion of exam).
i) Promptly determine if their patient is still intubated through accurately listing 3 immediatethings they can check at the bedside with expected values on a free text question on a writtenexam.
j) List the necessary medication and equipment to execute a safe transport off the unit with $80 \%$accuracy using a free text question on a written exam.
k) Classify an extubation readiness test (ERT) as successful or unsuccessful on a written exam, asassessed by $> / = 8 0 \%$ on a written MCQ exam.

o) Value the importance of interprofessional collaboration in enhancing patient safety duringventilator management, as assessed by a written reflection on one or more patient careencounters.
# Educational Strategies
1. Video – a video recorded by a respiratory therapist or pediatric ICU attending or fellowphysician. It will be brief, between 2-10 minutes. Nurses will get credit for completion ofwatching the video
a. Methods: Lectures
b. Highlights: can inform medical knowledge and / or technical skills. May be repeated forthose who want to re-enforce concepts, watch again as they encounter scenarios on theunit (e.g., re-watching the video about the oscillator if caring for a child on an oscillatorthat day)
2. Reading/Graphic – a brief article, graphic, or written presentation may be assigned for thelearner to review
a. Methods: Readings, visual graphic
b. Highlights: medical knowledge-based domains, passive learning
3. Quiz – A brief, 2-5 question test. Nurse will get a certain amount of credit for each questionanswered correctly
a. Methods: online learning, formative feedback / check-in experiences for videos andreadings
b. Highlights: medical knowledge-based domains, active learning
c. Types:
i. Multiple choice quiz
ii. Drag & Drop
iii. Matching
iv. Fill in the blank w/ a word bank
4. Clinical case vignettes – clinical scenarios
a. Medical management – Nurses are presented with images or clinical vignettes and mustidentify problems with current management or determine correct next steps.
b. Communication – Participants must “phone a friend” and summarize the scenario usingSBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) format to an RT orprovider. AI will analyze the text and award points based on SBAR use
c. Methods: deliberate practice with feedback, audio, visual,
d. Highlights: active learning, promotes interprofessional collaboration and teamwork skills
5. Quest – This activity requires the learner to complete a routine patient care task in real life (e.g.,correctly suction an intubated patient or patient with a tracheostomy they are caring for, boost$100 \%$ FiO2 on different ventilator interfaces on the unit that day), observed by an expert (i.e.,respiratory therapist or fellow/attending). This allows RNs to learn in real time, with their actualpatients (within their scope of practice), and from their co-workers in other fields, with provisionof formative feedback.
a. Methods: deliberate practice with feedback and team training roles, peer teaching,demonstration, role models, behavioral interventions, real-life and supervised clinicalexperiences, demonstrations
b. Highlights: promotes interprofessional collaboration and teamwork skills, great fordevelopment of hands-on, technical skills
6. Vent Lab – This activity will have a cartoon ventilator, where nurses must interact with theinterface. For example, they may observe values and be asked to identify a problem, solve aproblem, or boost FiO2.
a. Methods: role-play, artificial models
b. Highlights: problem solving, executive functioning (i.e., prioritizing, multi-tasking),autonomous decision making
